# CVE-to-PoC Generator

A security research tool that transforms CVE fix commits into practical Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrations. Analyzes security fix commits from GitHub advisories using AI to generate vulnerability test cases, attack vectors, and reproduction code for security testing and education.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧪 PoC Generation
- **🎯 Vulnerability Demonstrations**: Creates practical exploit code from security fix commits
- **💥 Attack Vector Analysis**: Identifies how vulnerabilities can be triggered
- **📋 Prerequisites Detection**: Documents conditions required for exploitation
- **🔧 Before/After Examples**: Shows vulnerable vs fixed code side-by-side
- **🧪 Test Case Generation**: Provides ready-to-run test cases for validation

### 🔍 Intelligent Analysis
- **🤖 AI-Powered Diff Analysis**: Uses Claude to understand what the fix actually prevents
- **🎯 Function-Level Targeting**: Identifies specific vulnerable functions and methods
- **⚙️ Configuration Analysis**: Detects flags, settings, or conditions needed for exploitation
- **📊 Multi-Language Support**: Handles Python, JavaScript, Java, Rust, and more

### 🚀 Efficient Discovery
- **📋 Advisory-First**: Extracts fix commits directly from GitHub Security Advisories
- **⚡ Direct Lookups**: No expensive repository searching needed
- **🌐 Multi-Ecosystem**: Supports npm, PyPI, Maven, Rust Crates, Composer, and more
- **📅 Recent CVEs**: Focuses on latest vulnerabilities for maximum relevance

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- GitHub Personal Access Token (optional, but recommended for higher rate limits)
- Anthropic API Key (required for PoC generation using Claude AI)

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tsuesun/cvetofix.git
cd cvetofix
```

2. **Install dependencies using uv:**
```bash
uv sync
```

3. **Set up API tokens:**
```bash
# GitHub token (recommended for higher rate limits)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"

# Claude API key (required for PoC generation)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_claude_api_key_here"
```

## 🔑 Getting API Keys

### GitHub Token
1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Generate a new token with `public_repo` scope
3. Copy the token and set as `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable

### Claude API Key (Required)
1. Sign up at [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Add credits to your account (minimum $5-10 recommended)
3. Generate an API key in the dashboard
4. Set as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable

**Note**: Claude AI is essential for analyzing fix commits and generating vulnerability PoCs. The tool uses Sonnet for better code analysis.

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
uv run main.py
```

### Recommended Usage (with API keys)
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token" ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_claude_key" uv run main.py
```

### Quick Test
```bash
# Set your API keys once
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_claude_api_key"

# Run the PoC generator
uv run main.py
```

### Example Output

## 🧠 How It Works

### CVE-to-PoC Generation Pipeline

### 1. CVE Discovery & Advisory Analysis
1. **Fetches recent CVEs** from GitHub's global security advisory API
2. **Extracts fix commit URLs** directly from advisory references
3. **Identifies vulnerable packages** and version ranges
4. **Prioritizes high-confidence sources** (advisory-referenced commits)

### 2. Fix Commit Analysis
1. **Downloads commit diffs** from the referenced fix commits
2. **Analyzes code changes** to understand what was vulnerable
3. **Identifies vulnerable functions** and attack surfaces
4. **Maps fix patterns** to vulnerability types

### 3. AI-Powered PoC Generation
1. **Reverse engineers vulnerabilities** from fix commit diffs
2. **Generates exploit code** that would trigger the vulnerability
3. **Documents prerequisites** (versions, flags, configurations)
4. **Creates test cases** showing vulnerable vs fixed behavior
5. **Provides attack vectors** and exploitation techniques

### 4. Output Generation
- **🎯 Vulnerable Functions**: Specific methods/functions that were vulnerable
- **📋 Prerequisites**: Conditions needed for exploitation
- **💥 Attack Vectors**: How the vulnerability can be triggered
- **🧪 PoC Code**: Ready-to-run exploitation examples
- **🔧 Fix Validation**: Before/after code comparisons

### 5. Multi-Language Support
The tool handles vulnerabilities across different ecosystems:
- **Python**: FastAPI, Django, Flask applications and libraries
- **JavaScript/Node**: npm packages, Express apps, React components
- **Java**: Maven dependencies, Spring applications
- **Rust**: Cargo crates and Rust applications
- **PHP**: Composer packages and web applications

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### GitHub API
- **Without token**: 60 requests/hour
- **With token**: 5000 requests/hour
- **Cost**: Free

### Claude API (Haiku model)
- **Input tokens**: ~$0.25 per million tokens
- **Output tokens**: ~$1.25 per million tokens
- **Typical usage**: ~$0.01-0.05 per 100 commits analyzed
- **Our optimization**: Only analyzes promising commits

## 🏗 Development

- `search_security_commits()`: Finds direct security fix commits with date filtering

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Personal access token for higher rate limits (recommended)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude API key for AI-powered analysis (highly recommended)

### Search Limits
To balance API usage with coverage:
- **PRs**: Last 50 pull requests per repository (with date filtering)
- **Commits**: Last 30 commits per repository (with date filtering)
- **Results**: Top 5 PRs and top 3 commits per CVE
- **AI Analysis**: Only commits with base score ≥ 4

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Rate Limit Issues
If you hit rate limits:
1. Set a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
2. Wait for the rate limit to reset (shown in error messages)
3. Consider reducing the number of CVEs processed

### Repository Not Found
Some packages may not have discoverable repositories:
- Package names don't match repository names
- Repositories are private or archived
- Package ecosystems use different naming conventions

### Claude API Issues
If Claude analysis fails:
- Verify your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check your account has sufficient credits
- System falls back gracefully to keyword-based scoring

### No Security Fixes Found
This can happen when:
- Fixes haven't been implemented yet
- Fixes are in private repositories
- Security patches are applied without clear commit messages
- The vulnerability is in a dependency, not the main package
